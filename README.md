# Super-Mario-Bros
This is a Super Mario Bros. clone that I made using the SDL3 library in C++. In this version of Super Mario Bros., you can play World 1-1, and the gameplay is the same as the original game, except for the fire plant and Fire Mario. Star Mario animation is a bit different from the original because I couldn't write it as I had intended. Unfortunately, the underground is not accessible in this version of Mario. Lastly, there is a flag pool, but it is empty. To play this game, run this command in the terminal section: ".\build\Debug\SuperMarioBros.exe". But your terminal should look like this example: PS C:\Users\User\Desktop\SuperMarioBros. To edit and run the game, you need two libraries. One of which is SDL3, and the other one is SDL3_image. You need to write the path of SDL3 and SDL3_image in the required sections in the CMakeLists.txt. Then, you need to run these three commands in the terminal section: "cmake -S . -B build", "cmake --build build" and ".\build\Debug\SuperMarioBros.exe". Finally, you can enjoy.
